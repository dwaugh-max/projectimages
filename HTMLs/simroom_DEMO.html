But intelligence reports have just shattered that illusion. A U-2 spy plane flying high over the jungles of Cuba has captured terrifying images: Soviet nuclear missiles are being assembled just 90 miles from the Florida coast. This violates every warning President Kennedy has issued.\n\nInside the White House, the secret 'Executive Committee' (ExComm) has been summoned. The air is thick with cigarette smoke and fear. The Generals are demanding an immediate invasion. The Diplomats are pleading for caution. You are an intelligence analyst in the room. Your job is to weigh the evidence, analyze the risks of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD), and guide the President through the most dangerous 13 days in human history.

To the untrained eye, they look like smudges in the jungle. But to the CIA photo-interpreters at the National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC), the shapes are unmistakable.\n\n**Visual Confirmation:**\nAnalysts have identified canvas-covered trailers and 'erector launchers'—equipment used exclusively for Soviet SS-4 'Sandal' Medium-Range Ballistic Missiles (MRBMs). These are not defensive weapons. They are offensive nuclear delivery systems.\n\n**The Timeline:**\nThe construction is rapid. The CIA estimates that the sites will be fully operational in **10 to 13 days**. Once active, the missiles can be fueled and launched in under 20 minutes. This creates a 'Use it or Lose it' scenario for the President: if he waits too long to act, the missiles will be ready to fire, and any attempt to destroy them might trigger a launch."

They view the placement of these missiles as a clandestine act of aggression that alters the status quo. General Curtis LeMay argues that the United States cannot tolerate a nuclear knife at its throat. He recommends **OPLAN 312**: a massive, surprise air attack to destroy the missile sites at sunrise, before they become operational.\n\n**The Moral Dilemma:**\nAttorney General Robert Kennedy (RFK) vehemently opposes a surprise attack. He passes a note to his brother: *\"I now know how Tojo felt when he was planning Pearl Harbor.\"* RFK argues that for the United States—a superpower and champion of democracy—to launch a surprise attack on a small island nation would be a moral catastrophe. It would destroy America's reputation and validate every piece of Soviet propaganda about 'American Imperialism.' The legal team struggles to find a justification for striking without a declaration of war."

Now, Khrushchev is returning the favor. The SS-4 missiles in Cuba have a range of 1,000 miles. A second type, the SS-5 (also suspected), could travel 2,200 miles.\n\n**Target Analysis:**\n* **Washington D.C.:** 13 minutes flight time.\n* **New York City:** 15 minutes flight time.\n* **Strategic Air Command (Omaha):** Within range of SS-5s.\n\n**The MAD Factor:**\nThis destroys the current warning system. Usually, if the Soviets launched intercontinental missiles (ICBMs) from Russia, the US would have 25-30 minutes of radar warning—enough time to launch our own bombers (Mutually Assured Destruction). With missiles in Cuba, the warning time is cut to **5 minutes**. This effectively decapitates the US command structure before the President can reach a bunker. It is a destabilizing 'First Strike' capability."

He bluntly tells the President: *\"This is almost as bad as the appeasement at Munich.\"* This is a stinging insult, comparing Kennedy to the leaders who let Hitler take over Europe.\n\n**The Military Guarantee:**\nLeMay assures the room that the Air Force can execute a 'surgical strike' to destroy 90% of the missiles before they can be launched. When asked about the surviving 10%, he dismisses the risk, arguing that the US nuclear arsenal is vastly superior. He is willing to accept casualties now to prevent a greater Soviet threat later.

However, they have a legal problem. Under international law, a 'blockade' is an act of war. It gives the blockaded nation the right to fight back.\n\n**The 'Quarantine' Solution:**\nTo navigate this legal minefield, they propose calling it a **'Strict Quarantine'** on offensive military equipment. It is a distinction without a difference physically, but diplomatically, it sounds less aggressive. It focuses only on weapons, allowing food and medicine to pass.\n\n**The Strategic Calculation:**\nMcNamara argues that the Blockade puts the ball in Khrushchev's court. If a war starts, it will be because a Soviet ship crossed a US line, not because a US bomb dropped on a Soviet camp. It buys time for negotiation and keeps the conflict at the conventional (non-nuclear) level for as long as possible."
